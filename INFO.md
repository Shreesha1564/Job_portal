<b>Express:</b>

A fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It simplifies routing, handling requests and responses, and middleware integration, making it easier to build robust web applications.
Use case: To handle HTTP requests and route users to different endpoints in a web app.

<b>Mongoose:</b>

A MongoDB object data modeling (ODM) library that provides a schema-based solution to model data, allowing you to define data structure, enforce validation, and manage relationships.
Use case: To interact with a MongoDB database easily, defining schemas and managing the database objects in a structured way.

<b>Nodemon:</b>

A tool that automatically restarts the Node.js server whenever file changes in your project are detected. It speeds up development by not requiring manual server restarts.
Use case: To improve development productivity by enabling hot-reloading in Node.js applications.

<b>jsonwebtoken (JWT):</b>

A library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens. JWT is used for secure user authentication by creating encrypted tokens that can validate a user’s identity without the need for continuous server-side sessions.
Use case: To implement secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms in a web app.

<b>bcryptjs:</b>

A library for hashing passwords using bcrypt, which adds an extra layer of security by making password encryption slow enough to resist brute-force attacks.
Use case: To hash and securely store user passwords in the database.

<b>cookie-parser:</b>

Middleware that parses cookies from incoming requests, allowing you to easily read and manage cookies (e.g., for managing sessions, authentication tokens, etc.).
Use case: To handle cookies in your app, typically for session management or storing authentication tokens.

<b>dotenv:</b>

A module for loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env. It allows you to manage sensitive configuration variables (like API keys, database URLs) outside of your codebase.
Use case: To safely manage configuration settings and environment variables in a project.

<b>cors:</b>

A middleware that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which allows your API or web app to handle requests from different origins (domains).
Use case: To enable API access from other domains, such as when building an API that a frontend application (hosted on a different domain) needs to interact with.

<b>Multer and Cloudinary</b>

We use Multer to handle file uploads for profile photos. When a user uploads a file, Multer processes it and extracts the necessary data. The uploaded file is then passed to Cloudinary, which stores the image in the cloud. After successfully uploading, Cloudinary returns a publicly accessible URL for the image. This URL is then saved in the database and can be used to display the profile photo.

<b>Radix UI</b>

Radix UI is a library of unstyled, low-level, accessible UI components for building custom design systems. It focuses on accessibility best practices, providing composable components like modals, dropdowns, and tooltips, which can be easily styled to match your design requirements, without sacrificing usability or accessibility.

<b>ShadCN UI</b>

ShadCN UI is a component library built on Radix UI that offers pre-styled, accessible components. It combines Radix’s flexibility with beautiful default designs, making it ideal for developers who want accessibility and styling out of the box while retaining the ability to customize for their design system.

<b>Vite</b>

Vite is a modern, fast build tool and development server for web applications. It features instant hot module replacement (HMR), fast builds using native ES modules, and supports modern JavaScript features out of the box. Vite is optimized for React, Vue, and other frameworks, improving development speed and performance.
